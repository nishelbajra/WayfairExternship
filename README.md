## 🗓 My Progress

### Week 1 – Orientation
- Reviewed program materials and met Program Manager Christie Andersen
- Set up n8n Cloud account and obtained Google Gemini API key
- Built basic "Hello World" workflow to test node connections
- Joined Slack community and familiarized with externship structure

### Week 2 – Project 1: Moodboard Generator ✅
**Goal:** Build an AI workflow that turns a short style idea into a moodboard using n8n and Google Gemini.

**Workflow:** `When chat message received → AI Agent (Gemini Chat Model) → Code (clean prompt) → HTTP Request (Gemini Image API) → Code (parse) → Image File Converter`

**Result:** Generated moodboard images from prompts like "Bohemian rugs, neutral tones." Encountered API rate limits but confirmed full end-to-end workflow execution.

**Screenshot:**

**Skills learned:** Building low-code AI agents with n8n, prompt engineering for visuals, handling API calls & rate-limit debugging, JSON parsing and data transformation

### Week 3-4 – Project 2: Consumer Trend Discovery Agent ✅
**Goal:** Build an AI agent that detects user intent, scrapes live product data, reads RSS feeds, performs Google searches, and generates intelligent HTML trend reports.

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Intent Detection:** AI agent classifies queries as "trend" or "non-trend" using Google Gemini, routing workflows accordingly
2. **Smart Non-Trend Responses:** Direct conversational answers for FAQs without triggering data-heavy searches
3. **RSS Feed Integration:** Multiple RSS Feed Read nodes capture real-time industry signals from design blogs (Dezeen, Design Milk, Nazmiyal, etc.)
4. **Google Search:** Google Custom Search API fetches live web results for trend-related queries
5. **Amazon Scraping:** Web scraping extracts product-level data (prices, features, descriptions) from Amazon product and collection pages
6. **Final Analysis & System Message:** Merges all data sources, adds a system message to define the agent's identity (expert trend analyst), boundaries (rugs category, last 7 days), output format (HTML report with executive summary), and editorial judgment. Generates comprehensive HTML trend reports structured like a Wayfair insight deck

**Result:** Complete end-to-end agent that transforms user queries into structured trend intelligence. Successfully tested with competitor analysis on Amazon rug listings, generating detailed reports that combine RSS signals, Google search results, and live product data.

**Skills learned:** Intent detection and workflow routing, RSS feed aggregation, API integration (Google Custom Search), web scraping (product/collection pages), data normalization and merging, system message design for AI agents, HTML report generation, end-to-end AI agent architecture

### Week 5-6 – Project 3: Competitor Monitoring Agent ✅
**Goal:** Build an AI agent that monitors competitors by scraping product data from Wayfair and Amazon, merging the data, and generating actionable competitive intelligence reports.

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Manual Competitor Analysis:** Analyzed Amazon's rugs category with 22 observations (pricing, features, messaging, tactics)
2. **Wayfair Scraper:** Built scraper to extract product data from Wayfair's rug listings (48 products scraped)
3. **Amazon Scrapers:** Reused and enhanced Amazon scrapers from Project 2, including Fallback Scraper for resilience
4. **Data Merging:** Combined Wayfair and Amazon data streams using Merge nodes
5. **AI Analysis:** Configured AI Agent with system messages to analyze competitor data and generate insights
6. **Report Generation:** Produced HTML reports with competitive landscape, benchmark summaries, and actionable recommendations

**Result:** Complete Competitor Monitoring Agent that scrapes, merges, and analyzes competitor data to identify pricing gaps, feature trends, and whitespace opportunities for Wayfair.

### Week 7-8 – Project 4: AI Insights & Content Agent ✅
**Goal:** Refine a pre-built AI Insights & Content Agent to transform trend and competitor data into creative marketing content that aligns with Wayfair's brand voice and tone.

**Workflow Steps:**
1. **Import and Explore:** Imported pre-built workflow JSON, explored workflow structure and node connections, renamed workflow to `Wayfair_ContentAgent`
2. **Evaluate Output:** Ran agent with test input (bohemian rugs from Amazon), generated content output, created evaluation Google Doc with observations, documented first impressions and agent analysis
3. **Teaching Your Agent Creative Thinking:**
   - **Studying Wayfair's Content & Voice:** Analyzed Wayfair blog post ("Ask an Editor: How to Flatten a Rug") and Instagram reel to understand brand voice (warm, inviting, confident, aspirational yet relatable)
   - **Creative Translation Layer:** Transformed data insights into creative marketing content with "why" context
   - **Rewriting System Messages:** Created 4 System Message variations:
     - V1: Pricing Strategy Focus (Analytical + Creative Mix)
     - V2: Feature Differentiation Focus (Lifestyle Benefits)
     - V3: Messaging & Imagery Focus (Aspirational yet Relatable) ⭐
     - V4: Emerging Trends Focus (Trend Storytelling)
4. **Run and Compare Creative Outputs:** Tested all 4 System Message variations with the same input data, generated comparison document, documented tone differences and content focus shifts, identified V3 as most authentic to Wayfair's brand voice
5. **Submit Your Updated AI Insights & Content Agent:** Refined final system message, generated final content output ("Wayfair Rugs Content Strategy: Dream Home, Real Life"), exported PDF report, recorded Loom video walkthrough, organized all documentation

**Result:** Complete AI Insights & Content Agent that transforms trend signals and competitor data into brand-aligned marketing content. The agent generates blog post strategies, Instagram captions, and creative content ideas that balance aspiration with relatability—matching Wayfair's authentic brand voice.

**Key Workflow Components:**
- **Find URLs:** Detects and classifies Amazon and Walmart product/collection URLs from input text
- **Web Scrapers:** Scrapes product and collection data from Amazon and Walmart (with error handling for bot protection)
- **Data Processing:** Extracts trend signals (consumer preferences, style trends, competitor benchmarks)
- **AI Agent:** Uses refined system message to transform signals into creative marketing content

   - Added Code node to tag outputs with agent_id
   - Added Supabase Get/Update/Create nodes for data persistence
   - Converted PDF output to HTML for consistency
4. **Project 3 Integration:** Connected Competitor Monitoring Agent to Supabase (agentId = 3)
   - Updated Code node with agent_id = 3
   - Connected Supabase nodes with agentId = 3
5. **Project 4 Integration:** Connected AI Insights & Content Agent to Supabase (agentId = 4)
   - Updated Code node with agent_id = 4
   - Connected Supabase nodes with agentId = 4
   - Fixed JSON parsing issues in Extract node for robust AI output handling
6. **Data Flow Validation:** Verified all 3 agents successfully store outputs in Supabase

#### Step 2: Google Sheets Dashboard Integration
1. **Google Cloud Console Setup:** Created OAuth2 credentials for Google Sheets API
   - Created project "n8nextern" in Google Cloud Console
   - Enabled Google Sheets API
   - Created OAuth Client ID with redirect URI for local n8n: `http://localhost:5678/rest/oauth2-credential/callback`
   - Configured OAuth consent screen with test user
2. **n8n Google Sheets Credential:** Configured Google Sheets OAuth2 credential in n8n

   - Connected Google Sheets credentials to all Update sheet nodes
   - Configured Spreadsheet ID and sheet tabs (1_TrendSignals, 2_CompetitorMoves, 3_Allinsights)
   - Verified column mappings for all three sheets
5. **End-to-End Testing:** Executed full pipeline and verified data flows from Supabase → n8n → Google Sheets

**Result:** Complete Market Intelligence Dashboard system that:
- Stores all agent outputs in Supabase database (persistent memory)
- Automatically processes HTML reports into structured JSON using Google Gemini
- Updates Google Sheets dashboard with real-time insights
- Provides 4-tab dashboard: Trend Signals, Competitor Moves, All Insights, and Executive Summary (auto-calculated)

**Database Structure:**
