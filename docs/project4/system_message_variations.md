## Testing Instructions

1. **Copy each System Message** into your n8n AI Agent node's System Message field
2. **Set the User Message (Prompt)** to: `{{ JSON.stringify($json) }}` or `{{ JSON.stringify($input.all()) }}`
   - This ensures the data is properly passed as JSON
   - If you see "undefined", try: `{{ $json }}` or `{{ $input.first().json }}`
3. **Run the workflow** once for each variation
4. **Document outputs** in your comparison table
5. **Note what changed** between versions

### Troubleshooting: If you get empty signals `["", "", ""]`

**Problem:** The AI Agent isn't receiving the data correctly.

**Solution 1:** Change the Prompt (User Message) to:
```
Analyze the following market data and extract trend, competitor, and style signals:

{{ JSON.stringify($json, null, 2) }}
```

**Solution 2:** If your data comes from a Code node, ensure it outputs:
```javascript
return [{
  json: {
    trend_signals: $input.first().json.trend_signals || []
  }
}];
```

Then use in AI Agent: `{{ JSON.stringify($json.trend_signals) }}`
