  - CSV Data: `competitor_manual_analysis_data.csv` (22 observations exported from Google Sheet)
  - Screenshot: `../screenshots/project3/step1_competitor_analysis_sheet.png`
  - Google Apps Script: `../../create_competitor_analysis_sheet.js` (script to generate the Google Sheet)
- Step 2: Wayfair scraper workflow - Completed
  - Screenshot: `../screenshots/project3/step2_wayfair_scraper.png`

  - Resilient scraper that finds product links from Amazon's bestseller pages
- Step 3: Merge, Analyze, and Prompt the Competitor Monitoring Agent - Completed
  - Merged all scrapers (Wayfair + Amazon) into unified pipeline
  - AI Agent with system messages for competitive analysis
  - HTML report generation with competitor insights
  - System message experiments completed (5 variations tested)

## Final Outputs
